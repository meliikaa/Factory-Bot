# Factory-Bot
**Note that this project will not start now, this is just outline for the upcoming project

We are embarking on the development of an advanced robotic solution designed to revolutionize tool retrieval and assistance within a dynamic industrial setting. Our envisioned robot boasts a multifaceted skill set tailored to meet the unique challenges of a bustling factory environment.

**Key Objectives and Features:**

1. **Tool Retrieval**: Our robot will possess the ability to promptly and accurately select the required tool from a predefined set in response to voice commands. This intelligence ensures efficient tool delivery to the requesting personnel.

2. **Voice Recognition**: Equipped with state-of-the-art voice recognition technology, the robot will distinguish and interpret voice commands even amidst the cacophony of a factory floor, ensuring seamless communication.

3. **Obstacle Avoidance**: Navigating through a constantly changing industrial landscape demands exceptional obstacle avoidance capabilities. Our robot will employ real-time obstacle detection and path adjustment mechanisms to safely maneuver around unforeseen hindrances.

4. **Noise Filtering**: Recognizing the inherent noise levels of a factory, the robot will be equipped with advanced noise filtering algorithms to enhance voice recognition accuracy and overall performance.

5. **Adaptive Obstacle Recognition**: The robot's ability to adaptively identify and respond to new obstacles is a crucial safety feature. It will continuously scan its surroundings, ensuring safe passage amidst evolving conditions.

6. **Durability**: To endure the rigors of a factory environment, our robot will be constructed with robust materials and mechanisms. Its structural integrity will enable it to withstand potential contact with welding and cutting equipment.

7. **Tank Tracks**: Incorporating tank tracks into the robot's design provides unparalleled mobility. This feature enables it to traverse diverse terrains and paths, ensuring it reaches its destination efficiently.

In essence, our envisioned robot is poised to be a reliable, versatile, and adaptive solution, seamlessly integrating with the dynamic industrial landscape while enhancing safety and efficiency.
